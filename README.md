Number Analyzer
===============

A tiny web app that analyzes numbers. I made this to learn Clojure.

Usage
-----
This is probably pretty obvious to anyone who uses Clojure, but you cd into the directory, then run the following commands to install the dependencies and start up a REPL:

    lein deps
    lein repl

Then you type this in the REPL to start up the server:

    (load "server")

Then open `localhost:8000` in a web browser.
